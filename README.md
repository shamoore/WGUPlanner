Task 1: Mobile Application Development

Introduction:

As a competent mobile application developer, your understanding of mobile application structure and design will help you to develop applications to meet customer requirements. The following project to develop a student scheduler/student progress tracking application, will help you to apply these skills in a familiar, real-world scenario. This task will allow you to demonstrate your ability to apply the skills learned in the course.

You will develop a multiple-screen mobile application for WGU students to track their terms, courses associated with each term, and assessment(s) associated with each course. The application will allow students to enter, edit, and delete term, course, and assessment data. It should provide summary and detailed views of courses for each term and provide alerts for upcoming performance and objective assessments. This application will use a SQLite database.
 

Input

Each of the following needs to be input into the application:

•   terms, including the following:

-   the term title (e.g., Term 1, Term 2)

-   the start date

-   the end date

•   courses, including the following:

-   the course title

-   the start date

-   the anticipated end date

-   the status (e.g., in progress, completed, dropped, plan to take)

-   the course mentor name(s), phone number(s), and email address(es)

•   objective and performance assessments associated with each course

•   the ability to add optional notes for each course

•   the ability to set alerts or notifications for the start and end date of each course

•   the ability to set alerts for goal dates for each objective and performance assessment
 

Output

Each of the following needs to be displayed by the application on a separate screen:

•   the navigation panel

•   a list of terms

•   a detailed view of each term, including the following:

-   the title (e.g., Term 1, Term 2)

-   the start date

-   the end date

•   a list of courses for each term

•   a detailed view of each course, including the following:

-   the course title

-   the start date

-   the anticipated end date

-   assessments

•   a list of performance and objective assessments for a selected course

•   a detailed view of each objective and performance assessment, including the following:

-   the due date for a selected course

-   notes for the selected course

-   sharing features (e.g., email, SMS)
 

Requirements:

Note: Submit your performance assessment by including all Android project files, APK, and signed apk files in one zipped.zip file.

Note: For definitions of terms commonly used in the rubric, see the Rubric Terms web link included in the Evaluation Procedures section.

Note: When using sources to support ideas and elements in an assessment, the submission MUST include APA formatted in-text citations with a corresponding reference list for any direct quotes or paraphrasing. It is not necessary to list sources that were consulted if they have not been quoted or paraphrased in the text of the assessment.
